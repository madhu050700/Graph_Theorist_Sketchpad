# Graph_Theorist_Sketchpad

Graph Theory Sketch Pad that allows one to: Model graphs and compute properties of said graphs, such as Hamiltonian Cycles and Bipartite.

How to Use:

download and run the program using the IDE
the click v on your keyboard. this will put you in "vertex creation mode" click anywhere on your screen to add a vertex there. 
click d, this will put you in "vertex and edge deletion mode" this will delete vertices and edges when you click on them. 
click e, this will put you in "edge creation mode" this will create and edge when you click on two vertices. 
click g, this will out put the degree of each vertex on screen.

The screen automatically shows the connectedness, hamiltonian,bipartite (if present) and ajacency matrix as you build the graph.
